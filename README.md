# Uroboros
#### Infrastructure for Reassembleable Disassembling and Transformation

### Fork motivation

This fork is made with the idea of extending this technique to ARM Thumb executables. In such process, the OCaml core has been completely rewritten in Python.

To this date the rewritten tool has been tested to work on the following executables: bzip, gzip, BLAKE2, Himeno benchmark, dcraw (with statically linked libjpeg and liblcms, ARM requires assumption 3), FLAC encoder (with statically linked libFLAC), dolfyn, OPUS encoder (with statically linked libopus, ARM requires assumption 3).

## Installation

Uroboros uses the following utilities (version numbers are in line with what was used during development, older releases may work as well):

| Tool        | Version   |
|:------------|----------:|
| python      | 2.7       |
| objdump     | ≥2.22     |
| readelf     | ≥2.22     |
| awk         | ≥3.18     |
| libcapstone | 3.0.5-rc3 |

and the following python packages (available through `pip` repositories):

| Package     | Version |
|:------------|--------:|
| capstone    | ≥3.0.4  |
| termcolor   | ≥1.1.0  |
| ELF-Esteem  | ≥0.1    |

## Build

Uroboros is now completely written in Python on the `allpy` branch. You don't need to build anything. However, you may want to modify some values in `config.py` to match your system configuration. Also, the parser, though recognising a large number of operators, is not complete; in case invalid operator exceptions are raised, these can be added to the right set in `Types.py`.

## Usage

Uroboros supports 64-bit and 32-bit ELF x86 executables and, experimentally, also Thumb2 ARM binaries.
To use Uroboros for disassembling:

```bash
 $> python uroboros.py path_to_bin
```

The disassembled output can be found in the `workdir` directory, named `final.s`. Uroboros will also assemble it back into an executable, `a.out`.

The startup Python script provides the following options:

* `-o output`

    This option allows to specify an output path for the reassembled binary.

* `-g`

    **NOT YET DEVELOPED**

    Instrument the output binary against ROP attacks using an adaptation of the technique described in [\[2\]](#gfree).

* `-gcc "parameters"`

    String of additional arguments a user may want to pass to the compiler.

* `-ex exclusions_file`

    Allows to specify a file containing a list of address ranges, in the format `hexaddress-hexaddress`, which will be skipped when searching for pointers in data sections.

* `-a assumption_number`

    This option configures the three symbolization assumptions proposed in the original Uroboros paper [\[1\]](#uroboros). Note that in the current version, the first assumption (**n-byte alignment**) are set by default. The other two assumptions can be set by users.

    Assumption two reqires to put data sections (.data, .rodata and .bss) to its original starting addresses. Linker scripts can be used during reassembling (`gcc -T ld_script.sty final.s`). Users may write their own linker script, some examples are given at `ld_script` folder.

    Assumption three requires to know the function starting addresses (work will be done on function splitting in order to avoid this requirement). To obtain this information, Uroboros can take unstripped binaries as input. The function starting address information is obtained from the input, which is then stripped before disassembling.

    These assumptions can also be used at the same time (`python uroboros.py path_to_bin -a 3 -a 2`)

## Stuff it would be nice to do
* **More testing on real applications and, after that, even more testing.**
* **Change the way data flow is managed**: now, to ease the debugging process, most of the data is passed along via file, which implies a lot of unnecessary IO operations.
